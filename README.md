## install instructions

- make sure `install.sh` is executable

  `chmod +x install.sh`

- run install.sh

## dependencies

- a shell would help

- preferrably either doas or sudo (otherwise, run `install.sh` as root)

## os compatability

realistically any system that has the following

- bash
- grep
- head
- sed
- cat
- /etc/os-release
